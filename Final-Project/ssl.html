                <h2>What is it to be secure?</h2>
                <p>To be secure, you would have to have the sensitive information you want to distribute be concealed and not available for viewing by unwanted intruders. In order to be secure, you would have to have encryption. Encryption is the art of concealing information that is only readable by the right people. Encryption on the internet involves information being altered by keys so that they are not understood by people who do not have these keys. Encryption is important and should be prioritized because it is in our favour to keep our important information private and not viewed by people who can steal it and harm us. Generally, information such as your passwords, credit card information, identity information, etc, are important to conceal and be secured so that they are not stolen and used against us.</p>

                <h2>What are the different encryption protocols?</h2>
                <p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that creates a safe and encrypted connection between a website and web browser and protects you from unwanted intruders and attackers. This protocol was first created by the Egyptian Cryptographer, Taher Elgamal in 1995, meaning it is now old and replaced by new protocols. This protocol is used for secure transactions while purchasing things as well as when handling private information, to avoid theft of info and causing harm. An SSL certificate is a type of digital certificate that connects the ownership details of a website to its cryptographic keys, certifying the website's safety and validity. During the SSL Protocol, these keys are used to create a secure session between the website and web browser. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a newer protocol that is now widely adopted throughout websites and encrypts the data being transferred between clients and websites. This makes it much harder for hackers and eavesdroppers to gather information such as passwords, credit card information, private messages, etc... The difference between SSL and TLS is that TSL is the new and more secure protocol that replaced SSL and simply is a better and improved version of it. </p>

                <h2>How do I know if my website is safe?</h2>
                <p>In order to tell that the website that you are viewing is secure and safe, you would generally see a lock to the left-hand side of the link of the site assuring you that the website is secure, encrypted and safe to place private and relevant information. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that is used for secure communication and the exchanging of information on websites which is what the lock symbolizes. It utilizes TLS for encrypting the communication protocol or formerly using the old SSL protocol. HTTP and HTTPS are important because they validate the security of a website, assuring that the data is encrypted and that the website's security certificate is valid.</p>
